Adventurer_app - feature notes:

1. log/reg w basic validations

1a. when a user is created they will receive gold = 30

2. user can create a character with this initial gold

2a. you will be able to give them a name, and choose their role

2b. the role will have preset attributes( str, def, spd - these stats currently do not have any use, 
will probably help the character increase their success rate in doing quests in the future.)

2c. you can view, edit(name),and delete the character
   //need to send a message saying if this character is deleted then you will not be able to quest. Are you sure?//

3. character is required in order to render the 'continue adventure' button

4. Continue adventure - will lead to a battle page where the user can do a quest.

4a. This quest will use the ninja gold assignments functionality of session.gold and session.rounds.

4b. we will then run if check on the session counts and gold obtain to render each div.

4c. the quest has a win/ lose --end dialog. you can then either return to dashboard or restart the quest.

4d. if we win then you will receive a random amount of gold from the quest giver. 
//This gold can be saved to the users account in the DB when you hit the logout button, logging out will clear the session. 

5. My stretch goal for this project would be to make it a fully functioning text-based adv with graphics later on.(currently researching)
